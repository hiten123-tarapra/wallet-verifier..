# Wallet Verifier Demo

This is a simple demo of the WalletVerifier UI with a single "Verify Assets" button and a popup message.

## How to use

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Click the "Verify Assets" button to see the popup.
3. Integrate your real wallet connection and verification logic inside `script.js`.

## Notes

- This demo uses inline CSS inside `index.html` for simplicity.
- Add your Web3 or TronLink wallet verification code in `script.js` as needed.
